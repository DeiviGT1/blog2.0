    <!-- Intro / Overview -->
    <p>
      <strong>MotivAI</strong> is an iOS application designed to provide
      personalized motivation and habit-building routines. I collaborated
      on this project with two colleagues, taking on both <em>application
      development</em> and <em>UI/UX design</em> responsibilities. Built in
      <strong>Swift</strong> and powered by <strong>Firebase</strong> for data
      management, MotivAI aims to seamlessly connect users with a specialized
      chatbot that offers daily encouragement and lifestyle tips.

        Our initial focus was on creating a smooth <strong>onboarding flow</strong>. 
        MotivAI offers multiple sign-in options—Google, Apple, or email—handled via 
        <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong>. This approach simplifies the login 
        process while maintaining robust security and giving users the flexibility 
        to choose their preferred login method. With Firebase handling the heavy 
        lifting, we kept the mobile UI clean and user-friendly.

      <p>
        After logging in, users are prompted to provide basic profile information: 
        their primary goals, preferred motivational style, and current habits. 
        This step plays a crucial role in tailoring the overall app experience. 
        We designed the onboarding screens with a <strong>minimalist look</strong> 
        and <strong>step-by-step prompts</strong> to avoid overwhelming new users 
        with too many forms at once.

        The heart of MotivAI is our <strong>OpenAI-powered chatbot</strong>. We’ve 
        customized the bot to deliver daily motivational messages, goal reminders, 
        and positive reinforcement. It can even adapt its “mood”—energetic, calm, 
        or empathetic—to suit the user’s preferences. This feature was a significant 
        technical challenge, as we had to manage token limits and asynchronous 
        response handling to keep chat interactions <em>snappy</em> and <em>reliable</em>.

        <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blogpost/motivai-3.png') }}"

        />
      </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        One of the core principles behind MotivAI is habit-building. Using <strong>SwiftUI</strong> 
        and <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong> (or Firestore), we track daily 
        progress on user-selected habits, allowing the chatbot to offer timely 
        nudges and reminders. This seamless integration between the chatbot and 
        habit-tracking feature provides a comprehensive motivational environment, 
        which we believe is crucial to sustaining user engagement over time.

          style="max-height: 600px;"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
            Lastly, the <strong>Settings Screen</strong> offers easy access to account 
            management and personalization options. Users can:
        </p>
        <ul style="">
            <li>Link or unlink their Google profile for data syncing.</li>
            <li>Adjust the chatbot’s mood or notification frequency.</li>
            <li>Log out quickly, ensuring their data remains private and under control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By centralizing these controls, we’ve aimed to keep the user experience 
            straightforward while still offering meaningful customization choices.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <p>
      Throughout development, our main focus was blending a <strong>clean, intuitive UI</strong> 
      with <strong>AI-driven motivational content</strong>. Whether users are looking 
      for quick daily inspiration or more in-depth goal-setting assistance, 
      <strong>MotivAI</strong> strives to deliver personalized support every step of the way. 
      Looking ahead, we plan to expand the app’s capabilities by integrating wearable 
      device data and introducing more granular habit metrics to further enhance 
      the motivational experience.
