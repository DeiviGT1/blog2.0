    <!-- Intro / Overview -->
    <p>
      <strong>Raisen</strong> is a personal project I developed to simplify travel 
      planning and offer creative visual content to users. Built with <em>Swift</em> 
      and powered by <strong>Firebase</strong> for data management, Raisen focuses 
      on two core functionalities: generating <em>personalized travel schedules</em> 
      using the <strong>OpenAI API</strong> and creating <em>city-inspired collages</em> 
      via <strong>DALL·E</strong>. Like my other work, the app supports 
      <strong>Google, Apple, or email sign-in</strong> to offer a seamless login 
      experience.

        <p>
          Similar to my other app projects, <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> 
          handles user logins in Raisen, allowing quick and secure access through 
          familiar platforms. I wanted to keep the onboarding as simple as possible 
          while maintaining strong security measures. As a solo developer, this 
          approach let me focus on the core features—analyzing user input and 
          integrating AI solutions—without rewriting login and database logic.

          At the heart of Raisen is an <strong>itinerary generation tool</strong>. 
          Upon entering a city name and specifying how many days the user will stay, 
          the app communicates with the <em>OpenAI API</em> to create a 
          personalized travel schedule. This schedule includes recommended 
          <em>tourist spots</em>, optimal <em>routes</em> to visit them, an estimate 
          of how long users might spend at each site, and even <strong>images</strong> 
          that showcase some highlights of the city.
        </p>

    <!-- Third Image -->
    <div class="project-image-text">
      <div class="project-image">
        <img
          src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blogpost/raisen-3.png') }}"
          alt="Raisen AI-Generated Itinerary"
          style="max-height: 600px;"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          To keep everything organized, I used <em>Firestore</em> (a part of Firebase) 
          to store user preferences—like which city they're interested in, how many 
          days they'll be there, and any personal constraints or preferences. This 
          data structure makes it easy to revisit or update a previously generated 
          schedule. The <strong>UI</strong> was designed to feel minimal and intuitive, 
          so users can quickly see the most critical information about their trip 
          without digging through cluttered menus.

        <p>
          Beyond itinerary planning, Raisen features a <strong>collage generator</strong> 
          that uses the <em>DALL·E API</em> to produce unique background images 
          based on the user’s chosen city. By simply entering a city name, the 
          app creates an <em>image collage</em> that can be used as a device 
          wallpaper or shared on social media. This feature was particularly fun 
          to develop, as it merges creative AI capabilities with user-generated 
          inputs, providing a delightful, personalized result.

    <!-- Fifth Image -->
    <div class="project-image-text">
      <div class="project-image">
        <img
          src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blogpost/raisen-5.png') }}"
          alt="Raisen Settings Screen"
          style="max-height: 600px;"
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          In the <strong>Settings Screen</strong>, users can update their 
          <em>login method</em>, adjust notification preferences for future 
          trip alerts, and of course <em>log out</em> or revoke access. Through 
          Firebase, all user data remains secure, while providing a convenient 
          way to sync preferences and maintain session state across sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a solo developer on this project, I handled everything from 
          <strong>UI/UX design</strong> to <strong>API integrations</strong>. 
          It has been a great learning experience, combining open-ended AI 
          interactions with structured app components. Looking ahead, I plan 
          to refine the routing suggestions by incorporating real-time data—such 
          as traffic or local events—and expand the DALL·E collage feature 
          for more creative output variations.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <p>
      In essence, <strong>Raisen</strong> merges travel planning with AI-driven 
      image generation, presenting a fresh approach to both functional 
      and aesthetic needs of travelers. Whether you’re looking for an 
      in-depth itinerary or a visually stunning backdrop reflecting your 
      chosen destination, Raisen aims to deliver an engaging, user-centric 
      experience. Stay tuned for ongoing feature enhancements as I continue 
      to explore new possibilities with AI and mobile development.
