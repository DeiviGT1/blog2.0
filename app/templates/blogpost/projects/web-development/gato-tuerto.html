      <!-- Introduction / Overview -->
      <p>
        <strong>El Gato Tuerto</strong> is an online liquor store project aiming to provide a
        seamless eCommerce experience for customers seeking a wide selection of spirits.
        From the very beginning, the development process was guided by continuous
        stakeholder collaboration, weekly milestone reviews, and a clear focus
        on user-centric design. 
      </p>
      
      <!-- Meetings and Initial Requirements -->
      <p>
        I started by meeting with the store’s manager and the owner to outline the
        high-level requirements: product categorization, an intuitive browsing
        interface, and integration with a delivery service. We agreed on an initial
        prototype that served more as an online menu rather than a full shopping
        cart experience. However, as the project took shape and weekly demos
        showcased the system’s potential, both the manager and the owner
        began to see the advantages of a complete checkout process. This meant
        customers could place orders directly, transforming the site from a simple
        product display into a fully functional eCommerce platform.

      <!-- Mid-Project Redesign -->
      <p>
        Midway through development, new feedback from the owner significantly 
        shifted our plans for the <em>Home</em> and <em>Catalog</em> pages. Initially,
        I had arranged these sections to emphasize product images and brief
        descriptions, following a minimalistic design. However, the owner desired 
        a more dynamic, content-rich layout to highlight ongoing deals and 
        emphasize certain premium products. Consequently, I rebuilt much of 
        the <em>Catalog</em> interface to accommodate additional filtering options,
        eye-catching banners, and bold promotional elements on the homepage. 
        This iteration demanded thorough refactoring of the UI but ultimately
        aligned the website more closely with the owner’s vision.

        />
      </div>

      <!-- Checkout Implementation -->
      <p>
        Another major addition was the <strong>checkout section</strong>. Once the 
        realization set in that El Gato Tuerto should handle actual online orders,
        I integrated a complete checkout workflow—cart, address details,
        payment steps, and order confirmation emails. This not only required
        redesigning the overall user flow (from browsing to purchase) but 
        also balancing constraints like inventory management and real-time
        pricing updates for certain high-demand items. We settled on a 
        staging environment to test each checkout feature before bringing it
        fully into production, ensuring the transition from a menu-like 
        structure to a robust eCommerce system went smoothly.

      <!-- Deployment with Vercel & GoDaddy -->
      <p>
        In parallel with these interface changes, the deployment strategy
        combined <em>Vercel</em> for hosting the front-end React application
        and <em>GoDaddy</em> for domain registration. Vercel’s serverless architecture
        enabled quick rollouts of new front-end releases, while GoDaddy provided
        a straightforward way to point the custom domain to Vercel’s infrastructure.
        This structure offered minimal downtime, a rapid feedback loop, and an
        easily maintainable environment that could adapt to evolving requirements.
      </p>

      <!-- Ongoing Marketing & Visibility -->
      <p>
        As the site went live, we initiated a multi-pronged <strong>marketing strategy</strong>
        to build visibility. First, we focused on <em>SEO</em>, optimizing page titles,
        meta descriptions, and relevant keywords around popular liquor brands
        and promotions. Over time, these efforts help improve ranking on search
        engines, ensuring interested customers can find El Gato Tuerto quickly.
        Additionally, the store’s staff started handing out simple promo cards
        during in-person visits, each featuring a link and QR code to the
        eCommerce site. This blend of digital and physical marketing not only
        boosted online traffic but also bridged the gap between traditional
        in-store shopping and modern online convenience.

      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <p>
        By fostering continuous communication with the owner and manager,
        embracing design flexibility mid-project, and deploying iterative
        releases every week, El Gato Tuerto progressed from a concept to 
        a professional, engaging eCommerce platform. Looking ahead,
        ongoing adjustments to the catalog, checkout interface, and 
        marketing campaigns will drive growth and ensure that 
        El Gato Tuerto maintains its competitive edge in the liquor retail market.
