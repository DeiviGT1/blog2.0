      <!-- Introduction / Motivation -->
      <p>
        The primary goal of this project was to build a <strong>personal portfolio</strong>
        that could evolve alongside my growth in web development and data engineering.
        Over a series of iterations, I experimented with different tech stacks—starting
        with a purely static approach, then refining it further, moving on to a dynamic
        React-based solution, and finally migrating to a <em>Python + Jinja</em> architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is an in-depth look at each major phase, the decisions that guided
        my choices, and the lessons learned at every step.
      </p>

      <!-- Version 1: Minimal Static HTML & CSS -->
      <h4>Version 1: Minimal Static HTML & CSS</h4>
      <p>
        The <strong>first version</strong> of my portfolio (<em>first image</em>) was built
        solely with <em>HTML & CSS</em>. My focus was on rapid prototyping and
        establishing a basic structure. I created sections for
        <strong>“Home,” “Academic Profile,” “Professional Profile,” “Projects,”</strong>
        and <strong>“Travels.”</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I kept the design <strong>simple</strong> to ensure I could quickly deploy
          a functional website. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Navigation was limited to basic links in a header menu, with no
          additional interactivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintenance was straightforward—just a few static files with minimal
          styling—but <em>scalability</em> was a concern for future additions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="project-image-text">
        <div class='project-image'>
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blogpost/portfolio-1.png') }}"
            alt="First iteration of the portfolio with minimal static HTML/CSS"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Version 2: Enhanced Layout & Design (Still Static) -->
      <h4>Version 2: Enhanced Layout & Design (Still Static)</h4>
      <p>
        Realizing that a purely minimal design lacked depth, I made substantial
        <strong>visual improvements</strong> in the <em>second version</em> (<em>second image</em>)
        while still relying on static HTML & CSS. This step did not yet incorporate
        React or any other JavaScript framework.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I refined the <strong>color palette</strong> and typography, giving the site
          a more polished and cohesive look.
        </li>
        <li>
          The layout became more <em>user-friendly</em> with better spacing, new 
          sections to highlight project details, and a simpler navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          I introduced some basic <em>JavaScript snippets</em> (e.g., for small animations),
          but the content remained primarily <strong>static</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While this version improved the user experience, I began feeling the need for
        a more dynamic, component-based solution that could handle expansions or
        feature integrations with less repetitive code.
      </p>

        <div class='project-image'>
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blogpost/portfolio-2.png') }}"
            alt="Second iteration with enhanced design but still static"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Version 3: Migrating to React -->
      <h4>Version 3: Migrating to React</h4>
      <p>
        The leap from static pages to a <strong>React-based</strong> structure occurred
        in the <em>third version</em> (<em>third image</em>). This was a significant
        shift in my workflow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I broke down the site into <em>React components</em>, each responsible
          for a specific part of the UI. This made the codebase <strong>modular</strong>
          and more scalable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Navigation was handled by React Router, providing a <strong>single-page
          application (SPA)</strong> feel. Page transitions became smoother without
          full page reloads.
        </li>
        <li>
          I started experimenting with dynamic <em>data fetching</em>, such as pulling
          my GitHub repositories to show real-time updates on my projects section.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This version introduced <strong>state management</strong>, improved user
        interactivity, and a more modern design approach. React also opened doors for
        advanced features like toggles (e.g., dark mode), API integrations, and
        live feeds.
      </p>
      <div class="project-image-text">
        <div class='project-image'>
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blogpost/portfolio-3.png') }}"
            alt="Third iteration, the move to a React-based architecture"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Version 4: Extending React for Better UX and Advanced Features -->
      <h4>Version 4: Extending React for Better UX and Advanced Features</h4>
      <p>
        Building upon the React foundation, the <em>fourth version</em> (<em>fourth image</em>)
        showcased further design improvements and introduced additional features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>complete redesign</strong> of the homepage, featuring a hero section
          with a background image, refined color scheme, and enhanced typography.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advanced <em>API integrations</em> for displaying external data, such as a
          Spotify widget or basic analytics pulled from other services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use of <strong>React Hooks</strong> for cleaner state logic, better
          performance, and easier testing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This phase improved my confidence in <strong>frontend development</strong>. However,
        I still needed a cohesive way to integrate more complex Python scripts related
        to data analysis, which led me to reconsider my approach for the backend.
      </p>
      <div class="project-image-text">
        <div class='project-image'>
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blogpost/portfolio-4.png') }}"
            alt="Fourth iteration, improved React UI with advanced features"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Version 5: A Fresh Start with Python & Jinja -->
      <h4>Version 5: A Fresh Start with Python & Jinja</h4>
      <p>
        In the <em>fifth version</em> (<em>fifth image</em>), I decided to
        <strong>restart the project</strong> and migrate from React to a
        <strong>Python + Jinja</strong> approach, embracing server-side rendering
        for better data handling and a simpler integration with my backend scripts.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>Flask-based</strong> (or similar) setup for routing, enabling me
          to easily merge database queries and analytics results into templates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Jinja templates</em> for each major section, facilitating dynamic content
          rendering and a clear separation of concerns. This also supports quick updates
          without manually modifying large swaths of frontend code.
        </li>
        <li>
          An updated design that maintained a <em>dark-mode aesthetic</em>, along with
          brand new branding elements such as a personal logo and sidebar navigation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This server-side approach aligned better with my ambitions as a <strong>data
        engineer</strong>, letting me import Python modules for data manipulation
        and analytics directly within the same environment as my site’s code.
      </p>
      <div class="project-image-text">
        <div class='project-image'>
          <img
            src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/blogpost/portfolio-5.png') }}"
            alt="Fifth iteration, restarting with Python and Jinja templates"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Deployment and Conclusion -->
      <h4>Deployment & Final Thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        Over these five versions, I learned the importance of <strong>iterative
        development</strong> and continuous improvement. Each transition, from minimal
        static pages to React, and eventually to Python + Jinja, was inspired by the
        desire to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make the site <strong>scalable</strong> for new features, whether in data
          visualization or user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integrate seamlessly</strong> with backend scripts, ensuring that
          data-driven elements could be added without complex client-side orchestration.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain a <em>professional and modern</em> look, reflecting my progression 
          in both design and development practices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the ability to pivot and adopt different technologies 
        (React vs. Python + Jinja) demonstrated my commitment to learning 
        and adapting. I plan to keep refining this portfolio by adding new 
        projects, integrating advanced data engineering demos, and exploring 
        microservices or SSR frameworks in future updates.
